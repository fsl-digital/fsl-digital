They may contain explicit guidance on pragmatics not found in native-speaker grammars. For example, accounts of German forms of address in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English–German manuals provide evidence of changing views on the appropriateness of               ihr               and               Sie               earlier than does the “native” grammatical tradition. The bilingual model dialogues that are typical of such manuals may also implicitly model appropriate linguistic behaviour, demonstrated here by examining the communicative genre of bargaining in a series of three related English–Dutch language manuals of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Furthermore, the dialogues may provide metalinguistic comment on linguistic behaviour – for example, by criticizing the culture of excessive negative politeness. Such sources can enrich our knowledge of language use and attitudes to language use in the area of politeness, complementing the evidence to be gleaned from mainstream native grammars, civility manuals, merchants’ guides, and the like.","2018","2025-04-28 10:16:41","2025-04-28 10:16:56","2025-04-28 10:16:19","28-54","","1","19","","JHP","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\debaj\Zotero\storage\6QY3KVT6\McLelland - 2018 - Mining foreign language teaching manuals for the h.pdf","","FSL","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More specifically we assess in which areas language expertise was expected from students and teachers and how nativeness, i.e., being a native speaker, was construed as an element of this general expertise. Our insights are based on the structure and content of the textbooks. Moreover, we analyse introductory texts, written by textbook authors or printers. The teaching material reveals a strong focus on spoken language as it consists of dialogues inspired by daily life and pronunciation guides that use a contrastive approach. Overall, our analysis suggests that the “ideal student” has to learn to speak a foreign language, thereby striving for a correct pronunciation and to communicate in a polite and pragmatically adequate way. The “ideal teacher” is a native speaker who has the authority to teach his mother tongue and to judge the teaching of others. However, the superiority of nativeness pales beside other required qualifications, i.e., learnedness, didactic skills and expertise in the language one teaches.","2023","2025-02-17 13:12:42","2025-02-17 17:51:06","2025-02-17 13:12:41","221-242","","2","9","","","The role of nativeness in early modern foreign language learning","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By examining an array of primary sources that range from poetry to theatre plays, from conduct literature texts to prose writings, women's habits in speech are discussed in relation to some of the existing linguistic varieties in use at the time in the peninsula, focusing especially on the native vernacular, the literary language - as it was codified in particular thanks to Bembo's Prose della volgar lingua (1525) - and Latin. Given that their use of spoken language was meant to be natural and devoid of embellishments, whenever women ventured beyond their usual linguistic contexts, they could easily be accused of affectation and artificiality in their speech.","2014","2024-10-29 15:47:41","2024-10-29 15:47:41","","400–417","","3","34","","","'FEMINA PROTERVA, RUDE, INDOCTA [...], CHI T'HA INSEGNATO A PARLAR IN QUESTO MODO?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","fu-berlin.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","","Publisher: Routledge","","C:\Users\debaj\Zotero\storage\FQUV5WLT\Sanson - 2014 - 'FEMINA PROTERVA, RUDE, INDOCTA [...], CHI T'HA IN.pdf","","","Language; Women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By drawing on a range of primary sources of different genres, the discussion will focus in particular on the diastratic varieties accessible to women and the type of learning and cultural exchange these same varieties could give access to. According to their rank and condition, women might have access, at different moments of their lives and with varying degrees of competence, to the local vernacular(s), the literary vernacular based on fourteenth-century Tuscan (the language of literature and the printing presses), the eclectic koinai of the Italian courts, the classical languages Greek and Latin (the language of the Church and of culture more broadly), as well as foreign languages. Knowledge of these different linguistic varieties determined in turn access to learning more broadly, as well as, more specifically, the consumption and production of works of literature of various kinds.","2022-03-17","2024-10-29 15:45:09","2024-10-29 15:45:09","2024-10-29 15:45:09","0","","","","","","","","","","","British Academy","","","","","","","Silverchair","","DOI: 10.5871/bacad/9780197267332.003.0003","","C:\Users\debaj\Zotero\storage\CAL6CBMH\372236950.html","","","","Kenny, Neil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Das Lehrbuch besteht aus 27 lateinischen Dialogen, denen als Lernhilfe deutsche Übersetzungen beigegeben sind. Die Dialoge sind denkbar einfach konstruiert, mit zwei Gesprächspartnern und kurzen Sätzen, und legen Wert auf die Vermittlung des lateinischen Alltagswortschatzes, wie er in den Lateinschulen ab einem bestimmten Alter obligatorisch war. Doch weniger als ein Jahr nach seiner Entstehung verbreitete sich das Gesprächsbuch weit über den Nürnberger Raum hinaus, Drucke sind für das Jahr 1527 in Erfurt, Krakau und Straßburg nachweisbar. Bis zum Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts war das Werk über einen Großteil Mittel- und Osteuropas verbreitet, neben Latein und Hochdeutsch finden sich sehr schnell drei-, vier- bis fünfsprachige Ausgaben mit weiteren Sprachen wie Niederdeutsch, Polnisch, Tschechisch, Ungarisch, Französisch oder Russisch. Für den außerordentlichen Erfolg des Lehrwerkes spricht auch, dass Drucke bis ins späte 18. Jahrhundert belegt sind. Der Beitrag wird sich mit den zahlreichen, durch die weite räumliche Verbreitung des Werkes bedingten Varianten im Bereich der Lexik in einigen ausgewählten Drucken beschäftigen. Die verschiedenen Varianten werden exemplarisch dokumentiert und die jeweilige Motivation für Bezeichnungswechsel nachgezeichnet. Dabei wird sich zeigen, dass offensichtlich nicht immer nur sprachgeographische Gründe für solche Bezeichnungswechsel ausschlaggebend waren.","2021","2024-07-11 08:21:26","2025-08-25 13:12:38","","251-268","","1","12","","","","Jahrbuch für Germanistische Sprachgeschichte","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Gesprächsbuch; historische Varietäten; Mehrsprachigkeit; Übersetzung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The papers of this interdisciplinary volume contribute to charting the developing field by presenting a survey of recent research from the different traditions of English, German and Romance language studies. Both the introductory paper by the editors and the individual papers deal with fundamental theoretical questions, e.g. the question of types of historical developments in dialogue forms, and methodological problems, e.g. the finding and interpretation of relevant data. The fifteen case studies presented in this volume provide a wide range of new data. The range of topics includes the pragmatic form of 16th century religious controversies in Germany, forms of polite answers in Early Modern German conversation culture, forms of dialogue in Early Modern English medical writing, learning English through dialogues in the 16th century, structures of bargaining dialogues in Late Medieval French, and reflections of spontaneous dialogue in Early Romance texts","1999","2025-07-23 13:16:18","2025-07-23 13:18:18","","","1","","66","","","","Pragmatics and Beyond","","","","John Benjamins Publishing Company","Amsterdam & Philadelphia","eng ger","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","DOI: 10.1075/pbns.66","","","","","","Jucker, Andreas H.; Fritz, Gerd; Lebsanft, Franz","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Jahrhundert","","3-484-52294-1","","","","The study aims at a change of perspective. Instead of focussing on language variation itself, it investigates the attitudes displayed by 16th-18th century grammarians concerned with the teaching of French as a foreign language. Perusal of the diasystematic marking practice employed in teaching manuals generates conclusions about the development of marking practice in the period in question, both in the context of these manuals themselves and in terms of the history of the language and of discourses on language philosophy, language policy and foreign-language instruction.","2011","2025-08-27 16:05:40","2025-08-27 16:05:40","","","","","294","","","","Beihefte zur Zeitschrift fur romanische Philologie","","","","De Gruyter","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\debaj\Zotero\storage\ZLLJCQ6E\Thelen - 2011 - Sprachliche Variation und ihre Beschreibung Zur Markierungspraxis in der franzosischen Sprachlehre.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Reprint 2011.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
